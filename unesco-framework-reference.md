## Framework Overview

The UNESCO AI Competency Framework for Teachers defines **5 competency dimensions** across **3 progression levels**, creating 15 competency blocks total.

### Five Competency Dimensions

| Dimension | Focus |
|-----------|-------|
| **1. Human-centred mindset** | Human agency, critical evaluation, responsible use |
| **2. Ethics of AI** | Bias, fairness, transparency, accountability |
| **3. AI foundations & applications** | How AI works, capabilities, limitations |
| **4. AI pedagogy** | Teaching with and about AI (out of scope for this project) |
| **5. AI for professional development** | Using AI for professional learning and growth |

### Three Progression Levels

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Acquire** | Foundational knowledge and skills; guided application |
| **Deepen** | Expanded understanding; independent application and adaptation |
| **Create** | Advanced mastery; innovation and leadership |

**This micro-credential targets primarily the Acquire level, with light movement toward Deepen in Videos 4-5.**

## Dimension 1: Human-Centred Mindset

### Acquire Level (Videos 1, 3, 6)

**Curricular Goal:** Teachers acquire basic knowledge and skills to critically evaluate AI technologies and develop a human-centred mindset that prioritizes student well-being and ethical considerations.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the importance of human agency in AI-assisted decision-making
- Recognize the need for critical evaluation of AI-generated content
- Identify potential risks and benefits of AI in educational contexts
- Develop awareness of the social and ethical implications of AI use

**Key Principles:**
- AI should support human decision-making, not replace it
- Teachers remain responsible for all professional decisions
- Critical evaluation of AI outputs is essential
- Human judgment and professional expertise take precedence

**Contextual Activities:**
- Evaluate AI-generated content for accuracy and appropriateness
- Reflect on how AI tools affect professional practice
- Identify situations where AI assistance is helpful vs. problematic

---

## Dimension 2: Ethics of AI

### Acquire Level (Video 3)

**Curricular Goal:** Teachers acquire foundational knowledge of ethical principles and develop awareness of ethical considerations in AI use for education.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand core ethical principles: fairness, transparency, accountability, privacy
- Recognize potential biases in AI systems and their outputs
- Identify privacy and data protection considerations
- Understand the importance of human oversight in AI-assisted decisions

**Key Ethical Principles:**

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Privacy** | Never input identifiable student/staff data; anonymize and generalize |
| **Transparency** | Understand AI limitations; know when to disclose AI use |
| **Accountability** | Teachers responsible for all AI-assisted outputs they use |
| **Fairness** | Review AI outputs for hidden biases; apply professional judgment |
| **Human agency** | AI supports decisions; humans make decisions |

**Contextual Activities:**
- Apply anonymization techniques before using AI tools
- Review AI outputs for potential bias or problematic content
- Understand and follow institutional AI policies
- Practice the principle: "When in doubt, leave it out"

## Dimension 3: AI Foundations & Applications

### Acquire Level (Video 2)

**Curricular Goal:** Teachers acquire a foundational understanding of AI technologies, their capabilities, and limitations for educational applications.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand basic concepts of how generative AI works (pattern prediction)
- Recognize AI capabilities: drafting, summarizing, reorganizing, brainstorming
- Identify AI limitations: hallucination, bias, lack of current/local knowledge
- Distinguish between general-purpose and source-grounded AI tools

**Key Concepts:**

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Pattern prediction** | AI predicts likely next words based on training data patterns |
| **Hallucination** | AI generates plausible but factually incorrect information |
| **Training data bias** | AI reflects patterns (including problematic ones) from its training |
| **Source grounding** | Some AI tools work only with uploaded documents, reducing hallucination |

**Mental Models:**
- "Autocomplete on steroids" — AI predicts likely text, doesn't reason
- "Junior assistant" — Fast and willing, but requires supervision
- "Echo of the internet" — Reflects training data patterns, including biases

### Deepen Level (Videos 4, 5)

**Curricular Goal:** Teachers deepen their understanding of AI applications and develop skills to adapt AI tools for specific professional contexts.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Apply structured prompting techniques (role, task, audience, tone, constraints)
- Iterate and refine AI interactions based on output quality
- Select appropriate AI tools for different professional tasks
- Create reusable prompt templates for recurring workflows

**Contextual Activities:**
- Develop prompt libraries for common professional tasks
- Practice iterative refinement of AI outputs
- Match tools to tasks (general-purpose vs. source-grounded)
- Evaluate when AI assistance is efficient vs. when manual work is faster

## Dimension 5: AI for Professional Development

### Acquire Level (Videos 1, 4, 6)

**Curricular Goal:** Teachers acquire foundational knowledge and skills to use AI tools for their own professional learning and productivity.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Identify professional tasks where AI can reduce friction
- Use AI to support planning, communication, and organization
- Apply AI to support reflective practice
- Understand AI as a tool that augments (not replaces) professional skills

**Key Applications:**
- Drafting professional communications (emails, newsletters, agendas)
- Summarizing documents and meeting notes
- Breaking complex tasks into manageable steps
- Generating reflective prompts for professional growth
- Organizing and synthesizing information

### Deepen Level (Videos 4, 5)

**Curricular Goal:** Teachers develop expanded capabilities to integrate AI into professional workflows and adapt tools to their specific contexts.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Create reusable templates and workflows with AI assistance
- Develop sustainable AI use practices (knowing when NOT to use AI)
- Apply source-grounded AI for accurate document analysis
- Synthesize information across multiple documents

**Sustainable Practice Principles:**
- Not every task benefits from AI
- Protect professional skills by using AI to augment, not replace
- Be honest about when AI is not helping
- Use AI intentionally, not reflexively

---

## Dimension 4: AI Pedagogy (Intentionally Excluded)

This dimension addresses teaching with and about AI in classrooms. **It is explicitly out of scope for this micro-credential**, which focuses solely on teacher professional productivity.

The micro-credential does not cover:
- Student-facing AI use
- Classroom AI instruction
- AI-assisted grading
- Student AI literacy

## Framework Principles Embedded in This Project

### Human Agency
> "AI should support human decision-making, not replace it."

Teachers remain responsible for every professional decision. AI provides drafts, suggestions, and organization—teachers provide judgment, context, and final approval.

### Critical Evaluation
> "AI-generated content must always be critically evaluated."

AI output is always a draft. Teachers must verify facts, adjust tone, add context, and ensure appropriateness before use.

### Ethical Responsibility
> "Teachers must understand and apply ethical principles when using AI."

Privacy, bias awareness, transparency, and accountability are non-negotiable. Professional responsibility cannot be delegated to AI.

### Continuous Learning
> "Teachers should develop their AI competencies as technologies evolve."

The goal is building judgment and confidence, not mastery of specific tools. Principles transfer across platforms.
