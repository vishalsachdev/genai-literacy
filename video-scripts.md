## Video 1 — Why GenAI for Teacher Productivity?
**Target runtime:** ~8 minutes (~900 words)

### Teleprompter Script

Welcome. In this micro-credential, we'll focus on how generative AI can support your work as an educator—planning, communication, organization, and professional growth. This course is intentionally not about student use of AI or classroom instruction. It is about supporting you as a professional.

Teachers spend large amounts of time on repetitive but necessary professional tasks. These include drafting emails, preparing plans, summarizing documents, organizing information, and reflecting on practice. While these tasks are important, they often crowd out higher-value work such as collaboration with colleagues, mentoring students and peers, and applying professional judgment.

Generative AI can assist with first drafts, summaries, and organization. When used well, it does not replace professional expertise. Instead, it reduces friction in everyday workflows. International guidance, including UNESCO's AI Competency Framework for Teachers, positions AI as a support for professional learning and growth, with teachers remaining firmly in control.

It's important to be clear about the scope of this course. We will focus only on teacher productivity. We will not address student use of AI, automated grading, or classroom AI policies. The emphasis is on ethical, low-risk uses that support your work while preserving professional responsibility and judgment.

Throughout this course, we will use two types of AI tools. The first is a general-purpose AI—useful for drafting, brainstorming, and open-ended tasks. The second is a source-grounded AI—one that works only with documents you upload, so it cannot hallucinate beyond your sources. The accompanying screencasts will show you specific tools your school provides. You will learn how to use AI by actually using it—each video is paired with a hands-on demo where you'll see these tools in action.

By the end of this micro-credential, you will have practical workflows, reusable prompt patterns, and a clearer understanding of when AI helps, when it does not, and how to use it responsibly in your professional life.

Let's start by understanding how these tools actually work.

## Video 2 — GenAI Foundations for Practical Use
**Target runtime:** ~10 minutes (~1,100 words)

### Teleprompter Script

Welcome back. In the last video, we talked about why AI matters for teacher productivity. Now let's look under the hood. Before using AI effectively, it helps to understand what generative AI actually is—and what it is not. This video will give you a practical mental model so you can use these tools with realistic expectations.

Here is the key insight: generative AI is autocomplete on steroids. Think about when you type a text message and your phone suggests the next word. Generative AI does the same thing, but at a much larger scale. It predicts what words are most likely to come next based on patterns it learned from billions of documents during training. When you type a prompt, the AI does not search a database for an answer. It does not reason the way humans do. It does not verify facts. It produces plausible-sounding responses based on statistical patterns.

This distinction matters because it explains both the strengths and the limitations of these tools. AI excels at tasks that involve generating fluent text based on patterns it has seen before. Drafting is one of them. Need a first draft of an email, a meeting agenda, or a summary? AI can produce something usable in seconds. Reorganizing information is another strength—turning bullet points into prose, or vice versa. Brainstorming works well because AI generates lists of ideas quickly, which you then evaluate and refine. Changing tone or format is straightforward. These are common teacher productivity tasks, and AI handles them well.

However, AI has real limitations that follow directly from how it works. Because it predicts likely words rather than reasoning about truth, it can hallucinate—producing information that sounds confident but is factually wrong. It can oversimplify complex topics or miss important nuance. It can reflect biases present in its training data. Think of it this way: AI has read a lot, but it does not know what is true. It knows what sounds right based on patterns. This is why AI output must always be reviewed and edited by a professional educator.

A helpful way to think about generative AI is as a junior assistant. Imagine a new staff member who is eager, fast, and willing to take on any task you give them. They can draft documents, organize information, and brainstorm ideas. But they lack experience. They do not know your school, your students, or your professional context. They will make mistakes. You would never send their work out without reviewing it first. The same is true for AI. It can save you time on first drafts and routine tasks, but it always requires your supervision and final approval.

There are two types of AI tools worth understanding. General-purpose AI tools are like an open-book generalist—they draw on broad training data to help with brainstorming, drafting, and open-ended tasks. Source-grounded AI tools are different. They work only with documents you upload. They cannot make things up from the internet. They can only tell you what is in your sources, with citations you can verify. Think of general-purpose AI as an open-book generalist and source-grounded AI as a closed-book research librarian.

In the accompanying screencast, you will see how to access these tools and try your first prompts. Once you have that foundation, we will turn to something equally important: using these tools responsibly.

## Video 3 — Ethical & Responsible Use for Teachers
**Target runtime:** ~10 minutes (~1,100 words)

### Teleprompter Script

Welcome back. Now that you understand how AI works, let's talk about how to use it responsibly. This matters—not just for compliance, but because the trust students and families place in us as educators is not something we can afford to compromise.

Let's start with the most important principle: privacy and confidentiality. When you type something into a public AI tool, that information gets processed on external servers—servers you do not control. This means you should never input student names, grades, behavior records, IEP information, or any other identifiable student data into AI tools. The same goes for confidential staff information, sensitive internal communications, or anything FERPA or your district's data policies protect.

This does not mean you cannot use AI for tasks involving students or personnel. It means you must anonymize and generalize before you type. Instead of writing "summarize this behavior report for Marcus Johnson in my third period class," you would write "summarize a behavior report for a middle school student who has difficulty staying on task." Remove names, dates, and identifying details. Describe the situation in general terms. This allows you to get useful AI assistance without compromising anyone's privacy.

Some AI tools offer stronger privacy protections than others. When you use AI tools through your school account, your data typically stays within your organization's domain, and the company does not use it to train their models. This is different from using a personal account on a public AI service. Always use your school-provided tools and accounts for professional work when available.

The second consideration is bias. Remember what we said in the last video—AI is autocomplete on steroids, predicting likely words based on patterns. Those patterns come from human language and culture, including its biases. AI suggestions may contain hidden assumptions about race, gender, ability, or socioeconomic status. These biases are often subtle. An AI might suggest language that sounds professional but carries unintended connotations.

Here is another way to think about it: AI is an echo of the internet. It reflects patterns in the data it was trained on, including problematic patterns. As an educator, you must critically review AI suggestions, especially when they relate to people, performance, or decisions. Your professional judgment is the essential filter.

The third consideration is human agency. International ethical frameworks, including UNESCO's guidance on AI in education, emphasize that AI should support human decision-making, not replace it. The teacher remains responsible for every decision. If you use AI to draft an email and then send it, you are responsible for its content. AI is an assistant. You are the professional.

Many districts and schools now have formal AI policies. Before using AI tools for professional tasks, find out what your institution permits. Policies may specify which tools are approved, what types of data can be processed, and what disclosures are required. If your school does not yet have a policy, or if you are unsure, ask your administrator. It is better to clarify expectations before you start than to discover a problem later.

A simple rule of thumb can guide your decisions: if you would not share the information with someone outside your institution, do not share it with AI. This applies to student information, personnel matters, internal disagreements, and anything else that should stay within your professional setting. When in doubt, leave it out.

In the screencast for this video, you will see how source-grounded AI tools can work with documents more safely. Because they only reference documents you upload—and cannot access external information—they reduce some risks. But the principles of anonymization and professional judgment still apply.

With these ethical foundations in place, we are ready to get practical. In the next video, we will build workflows for writing, planning, and communication.

## Video 4 — Writing, Planning & Communication Workflows
**Target runtime:** ~11 minutes (~1,200 words)

### Teleprompter Script

Welcome back. We have covered the foundations and the ethics. Now let's put AI to work. One of the highest-impact uses of AI for teacher productivity is reducing the time you spend drafting professional communication. This video will show you how to structure effective prompts and integrate AI into your writing workflows.

Think about the range of professional writing you do: emails to colleagues, parents, and administrators; newsletters and updates; meeting agendas and minutes; professional development descriptions; reusable templates; end-of-year reports. Each takes time. Many involve similar structures you recreate from scratch each time. AI can help with all of them.

The key to getting useful output from AI is writing effective prompts. Think of prompting as giving instructions to that junior assistant we discussed earlier. Vague instructions produce vague results. Specific instructions produce something much closer to what you need.

A reliable structure for professional prompts includes five elements. First is role. Tell the AI who it should act as. "Act as a professional K-12 educator." This sets context and helps the AI adopt an appropriate voice. Second is task. Be specific about what output you need. "Draft an email" is clearer than "help me with an email." Third is audience. Who will read or use the output? Writing for parents differs from writing for colleagues. Fourth is tone. What style is appropriate? Options might include "respectful and clear," "encouraging," or "formal." Fifth is constraints. Are there limits on length, format, or content? You might specify "under 200 words" or "bullet points only."

Here is an example that uses all five elements: "Act as a professional K-12 educator. Draft a concise email to parents about the upcoming science fair. Tone should be encouraging and informative. Length should be under 200 words. Include the date, time, and what students should bring."

When a prompt produces weak output, check which element is missing. If the tone is wrong, specify it. If the output is too long, add a length constraint. If it sounds generic, add more context about your audience.

You do not need to write perfect prompts on your first try. Start simple. See what the AI returns. Then refine based on what is missing. This iterative approach—prompt, review, refine—is often faster than trying to craft a perfect prompt upfront. Think of it as a conversation with that junior assistant: you give initial instructions, see what they produce, then provide feedback.

Once you have output from AI, your work is not done. AI output is always a draft. It does not know your school, your students, your relationships, or the specific context of your communication. Read everything the AI produces. Check facts if any are included. Adjust the tone to match your voice. Add details that only you know. Remove anything that does not fit. The goal is not to use AI output as-is. The goal is to start further along than a blank page.

Over time, you will develop a library of prompts that work well for your recurring tasks. A prompt that produces a good weekly newsletter draft can be reused and refined. In the screencast, you will see these prompting techniques in action and how to save effective prompts for reuse.

Writing is just one part of your workload. In the next video, we will tackle something equally demanding: managing the constant flow of information that comes with teaching.

## Video 5 — Organizing Information & Managing Time
**Target runtime:** ~9 minutes (~1,000 words)

### Teleprompter Script

Welcome back. In the last video, we focused on creating content—drafting emails, writing plans. Now let's flip the perspective: managing the content that comes to you. Teachers face constant information overload. Emails pile up. Policy documents arrive. Meeting notes need to be reviewed. Research articles sit unread. AI can help manage this overload—not by replacing your thinking, but by organizing information so you can engage with it more effectively.

Summarization is one of the most practical uses of AI for busy educators. Consider the types of documents you encounter regularly. Meeting notes from committees or PLCs often run several pages. District policy updates can be dense and lengthy. Research articles may be valuable but time-consuming.

This is where source-grounded AI tools become particularly valuable. Unlike general-purpose AI, which works from broad training data, source-grounded tools work only with documents you upload. You can paste or upload meeting notes, policy documents, or research articles, then ask questions and get summaries grounded in those specific sources. Every answer includes citations showing exactly where the information came from. This matters for accuracy—you can verify that the summary actually reflects what the document says.

Some source-grounded tools also offer audio summary features that create podcast-style conversations about your documents. Two AI voices discuss the key points in a natural, engaging way. This is useful for understanding complex documents while commuting or doing other tasks. You can even customize the focus—asking it to emphasize implications for elementary teachers, for example, or to explain concepts for someone new to the topic.

Beyond summarization, AI can help with planning and task breakdown. Complex professional tasks often feel overwhelming because they lack clear structure. Writing a grant proposal, preparing for an accreditation review, planning a new curriculum unit—these involve many steps that are not always obvious at the start.

AI can help you break a large task into manageable steps. You can describe what you need to accomplish and ask for a step-by-step breakdown. You can request a suggested timeline or sequence. This gives you a starting structure that you then adapt to your actual constraints.

The key word is adapt. AI does not know your calendar, your workload, or your school's priorities. It will suggest steps that sound reasonable in the abstract but may not fit your reality. Your job is to review AI suggestions against what you actually know. Adjust timelines. Reorder steps based on dependencies you understand. Add tasks the AI missed. Remove steps that do not apply. The AI provides a starting point. You provide the professional judgment.

In the screencast, you will see how to upload documents to a source-grounded AI tool, ask questions with citations, generate audio summaries, and use general-purpose AI for task breakdown and planning.

We have covered a lot of practical ground. In our final video, we will step back and think about the bigger picture: reflection, growth, and building sustainable habits with AI.

## Video 6 — Reflection, Growth & Sustainable Use
**Target runtime:** ~9 minutes (~1,000 words)

### Teleprompter Script

Welcome back to our final video. We have covered a lot of ground together—how AI works, how to use it ethically, how to draft and organize with it. Now I want to step back and talk about something more personal: your own growth as a professional, and how to build habits with AI that actually serve you over time.

Reflection is central to professional growth. Taking time to think about your practice, identify what is working, and consider what to change—this is how educators improve. AI can support reflection, though it cannot do the reflecting for you.

One way AI can help is by generating reflective prompts. If you want to think about your week but are not sure where to start, you can ask AI to suggest questions. What went well in my professional work this week and why? What challenge did I face and how did I respond? What would I do differently? These prompts can help structure your thinking, especially when you are tired or short on time.

AI can also help organize your reflections over time. If you keep a running journal or notes, you can upload them to a source-grounded AI tool and ask it to identify patterns. What themes keep emerging? What areas appear repeatedly as challenges? This kind of synthesis can be useful during goal-setting or evaluation cycles.

But here is the thing: the reflection itself must be yours. AI can prompt you. It can organize your notes. But the honest assessment of your practice, the decision about what matters, the commitment to change—these come from you. No tool can do that for you, and you would not want it to. Use AI as a scaffold, not a substitute.

AI can also support professional learning more broadly. Teachers are often asked to engage with research, read articles, complete professional development modules, or set growth goals. AI can help summarize dense PD materials so you can decide what deserves deeper attention. It can help you articulate learning goals in clear, measurable terms.

The final and perhaps most important point is sustainability. Not every task benefits from AI. Not every moment calls for a tool. Sustainable use means choosing AI intentionally—using it when it genuinely helps, and setting it aside when it does not.

Some tasks are faster without AI. If you can write an email in two minutes, opening an AI tool may slow you down. Some tasks benefit from the unstructured thinking that comes with a blank page.

Sustainable use also means protecting your own skills. Writing, summarizing, and organizing are professional competencies. If you outsource them entirely, you risk losing fluency. Use AI to augment your capabilities, not to replace them.

Be honest about when AI is not helping. Remember the junior assistant from Video 2? Sometimes that assistant creates more work than they save. If you find yourself spending more time editing AI output than you would have spent writing from scratch, that is a signal. Pay attention to what actually works for you.

Over these six videos, we have covered a lot: how AI works, why ethics matter, how to write effective prompts, how to manage information overload, and now, how to grow and sustain your practice. The goal was never to use AI as much as possible. The goal is to use it well—where it helps, how it helps, and always with your professional judgment firmly in control.

In the final screencast, you will see how to use AI for reflection and how to audit your own AI use for sustainability.

Thank you for spending this time with me. Teaching is demanding work, and anything that gives you back even a little time and energy is worth exploring. I hope these tools serve you well—not as a replacement for what you do, but as support for the professional you already are.
