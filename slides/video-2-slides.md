# GenAI Foundations for Practical Use

## Understanding How AI Actually Works

---

# What We'll Cover

Before using AI effectively, it helps to understand:

- What generative AI **actually is**
- What it **is not**
- A practical mental model for realistic expectations

> "AI is <span class="highlight">autocomplete on steroids</span>."

Think about when you type a text message and your phone suggests the next word...

# How AI Works

<div class="sketch-box">

**The key insight:**

AI predicts what words are most likely to come next based on patterns it learned from billions of documents.

- It does **not** search a database
- It does **not** reason like humans
- It does **not** verify facts
- It produces plausible-sounding responses based on **statistical patterns**

# AI Strengths

<div>

## Good At

- ✓ Fast first drafts
- ✓ Rephrasing & tone adjustment
- ✓ Brainstorming & ideation
- ✓ Summarizing long content
- ✓ Organizing information
- ✓ Explaining differently

</div>

<div>

## Why These Work

AI excels at generating fluent text based on patterns it has seen before.

These are common teacher productivity tasks!

# AI Limitations

<div>

## Watch Out For

- ✗ Hallucinations (making things up)
- ✗ Reflecting training data biases
- ✗ Oversimplifying complex topics
- ✗ No understanding of your context
- ✗ Confident even when wrong

</div>

<div>

## Why These Happen

AI predicts **likely** words, not **true** words.

<span class="underline">AI knows what sounds right, not what is right.</span>

# Think of AI as a Junior Assistant

# The Junior Assistant Mental Model

<div class="callout">

Imagine a new staff member who is:
- **Eager** and fast
- Willing to take on any task
- Lacks experience with your school, students, and context
- **Will make mistakes**

You would never send their work out without reviewing it first.

</div>

**The same is true for AI.**

![Junior Assistant](./assets/diagrams/v2-junior-assistant.svg)

---

<!-- _class: columns -->

# Two Types of AI Tools

<div>

## General-Purpose AI

"Open-book generalist"

- Draws on broad training data
- Good for brainstorming, drafting
- Can hallucinate freely

*Like an assistant who has read widely but doesn't know your context*

</div>

<div>

## Source-Grounded AI

"Closed-book librarian"

- Works only with your documents
- Provides citations you can verify
- Cannot make things up

*Like a research assistant limited to documents you provide*

</div>

---

<!-- _class: summary -->

# Key Takeaways

- AI is autocomplete at massive scale—**pattern matching, not reasoning**
- Strong at drafting, organizing, brainstorming
- Weak at facts, nuance, context
- Think: **junior assistant** who needs supervision
- Your **professional judgment** is always required
