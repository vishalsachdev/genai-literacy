# General-Purpose AI

<div>

## What It Is

An **open-book generalist** that draws on broad training data

## Good For

# Source-Grounded AI

<div>

## What It Is

A **closed-book librarian** that works only with documents you upload

## Good For

- Analyzing your documents
- Finding information in sources
- Getting citations you can verify
- Avoiding hallucination

</div>

<div>

## Think of it as...

A research assistant who can only tell you what's in the documents you give them

<!-- Placeholder for Excalidraw diagram -->
<!-- ![Source-grounded AI](./assets/diagrams/source-grounded-ai.svg) -->

</div>

# Learning by Doing

<div class="sketch-box-alt">

Each video is paired with a **hands-on screencast** where you'll see these tools in action.

You will learn how to use AI by actually using it.
