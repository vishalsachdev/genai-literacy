# Writing, Planning & Communication

## Practical AI Workflows

# What We'll Cover

One of the highest-impact uses of AI:

**Reducing time spent drafting professional communication**

- Effective prompt structure
- The iteration cycle
- From draft to final

---

# Your Professional Writing Load

<div class="sketch-box">

- Emails to colleagues, parents, administrators
- Newsletters and updates
- Meeting agendas and minutes
- Professional development descriptions
- Reusable templates
- End-of-year reports

</div>

Each takes time. Many involve similar structures you recreate from scratch.

# Think: Instructions to Your Junior Assistant

<div class="callout">

**Vague instructions** → vague results

**Specific instructions** → usable output

</div>

The key is structure.

# 5 Elements of a Good Prompt

| Element | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Role** | Set context | "Act as a K-12 educator" |
| **Task** | Define output | "Draft an email" |
| **Audience** | Clarify reader | "For parents" |
| **Tone** | Set style | "Warm and encouraging" |
| **Constraints** | Add limits | "Under 200 words" |

# Example: All 5 Elements

<div class="sketch-box">

"Act as a professional K-12 educator.

Draft a concise email to parents about the upcoming science fair.

Tone should be encouraging and informative.

Length should be under 200 words.

Include the date, time, and what students should bring."

</div>

---

# Debugging Weak Output

When AI returns poor results, check which element is missing:

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Wrong tone | Specify tone explicitly |
| Too long | Add length constraint |
| Too generic | Add audience context |
| Off-topic | Clarify the task |

# The Iteration Cycle

---

# You Don't Need Perfect Prompts

<div class="callout">

**The iterative approach:**

1. Start simple
2. See what AI returns
3. Refine based on what's missing

This is often faster than crafting a "perfect" prompt upfront.

</div>

Think of it as a conversation with your junior assistant.

![Iteration Cycle](./assets/diagrams/v4-iteration-cycle.svg)

---

<!-- _class: divider -->

# From Draft to Final

---

# AI Output Is Always a Draft

AI does not know:
- Your school
- Your students
- Your relationships
- Your specific context

<span class="highlight">The goal is to start further along than a blank page.</span>

---

# Your Review Checklist

- ✓ Read everything AI produces
- ✓ Check facts if any are included
- ✓ Adjust tone to match your voice
- ✓ Add details only you know
- ✓ Remove anything that doesn't fit

# Key Takeaways

- Use 5-element prompt structure: **Role, Task, Audience, Tone, Constraints**
- **Iterate** rather than aiming for perfection
- AI output is a **starting point**, not a final product
- Build a library of prompts that work for your recurring tasks
