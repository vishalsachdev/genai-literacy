# Ethical & Responsible Use

## Privacy, Bias & Professional Judgment

---

# Why This Matters

<div class="callout">

The trust students and families place in us as educators is not something we can afford to compromise.

</div>

This video covers:
- Privacy & confidentiality
- Bias awareness
- Human agency & control
- School policies

# Principle 1: Privacy

---

# The Privacy Boundary

When you type something into AI:
- That information gets processed on **external servers**
- Servers you **do not control**

<div class="sketch-box">

**Never input:**
- Student names, grades, behavior records
- IEP information
- Confidential staff information
- FERPA-protected data

</div>

# The Solution: Anonymize & Generalize

<!-- _class: columns -->

<div>

## Instead of...

"Summarize this behavior report for Marcus Johnson in my third period class"

</div>

<div>

## Write...

"Summarize a behavior report for a middle school student who has difficulty staying on task"

</div>

# School Account vs. Personal Account

| School Account | Personal Account |
|----------------|------------------|
| Data stays in your org | Goes to public servers |
| Not used for training | May be used for training |
| IT oversight | No oversight |
| Compliant storage | No guarantees |

<span class="highlight">Always use school-provided tools for professional work.</span>

# Principle 2: Bias Awareness

---

# AI Reflects Its Training Data

<div class="callout">

**Remember:** AI is autocomplete on steroids.

Those patterns come from human language and culture—**including its biases**.

</div>

AI suggestions may contain hidden assumptions about:
- Race
- Gender
- Ability
- Socioeconomic status

---

<!-- _class: quote -->

> "AI is an <span class="highlight">echo of the internet</span>. It reflects patterns in training data, including problematic patterns."

Your professional judgment is the essential filter.

# Principle 3: Human Agency

---

# You Are Always Responsible

<div class="sketch-box">

International frameworks (including UNESCO) emphasize:

- AI should **support** human decision-making
- AI should **not replace** human decision-making
- The teacher remains responsible for **every decision**

</div>

If you use AI to draft an email and send it, **you are responsible for its content**.

---

# Know Your School's Policy

Before using AI:

- ✓ Find out what tools are approved
- ✓ Understand what data can be processed
- ✓ Know what disclosures are required
- ✓ Ask your administrator if unsure

<span class="underline">Better to clarify before you start.</span>

---

<!-- _class: summary -->

# The Simple Rule

<div class="callout">

**If you would not share the information with someone outside your institution, do not share it with AI.**

</div>

This applies to:
- Student information
- Personnel matters
- Internal disagreements
- Anything that should stay within your setting
