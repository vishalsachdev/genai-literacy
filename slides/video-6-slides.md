# AI for Reflection

---

# Reflection Is Central to Growth

Taking time to:
- Think about your practice
- Identify what's working
- Consider what to change

This is how educators improve.

<span class="highlight">AI can support reflection—but cannot do the reflecting for you.</span>

---

# How AI Can Help

<div class="sketch-box">

**Generate reflective prompts:**
- What went well this week and why?
- What challenge did I face? How did I respond?
- What would I do differently?

**Organize reflections over time:**
- Upload journal notes to source-grounded AI
- Ask it to identify patterns and themes

</div>

# Sustainable AI Use

---

# Not Every Task Benefits from AI

<div class="callout">

**Sustainable use means choosing AI intentionally:**

Using it when it genuinely helps.

Setting it aside when it doesn't.

</div>

# When to Use AI

<div>

## Good for AI

- ✓ Brainstorming ideas
- ✓ Organizing information
- ✓ Breaking down tasks
- ✓ Rephrasing for audiences

</div>

<div>

## Skip the AI

- ✗ Quick 2-sentence replies
- ✗ Relationship building
- ✗ Sensitive conversations
- ✗ Creative work you enjoy
- ✗ Skills you want to maintain
- ✗ Tasks with private data

</div>

# Protect Your Own Skills

<div class="sketch-box">

Writing, summarizing, and organizing are **professional competencies**.

If you outsource them entirely, you risk losing fluency.

**Use AI to augment your capabilities, not replace them.**

# Be Honest About What Works

<div class="callout">

Remember the junior assistant?

Sometimes they create **more work** than they save.

If you spend more time editing AI output than writing from scratch—that's a signal.

**Pay attention to what actually works for you.**

</div>
