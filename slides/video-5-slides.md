# Organizing Information & Managing Time

## Taming Information Overload

---

# The Challenge

<div class="callout">

Teachers face **constant information overload**:

- Emails pile up
- Policy documents arrive
- Meeting notes need review
- Research articles sit unread

</div>

AI can help—not by replacing your thinking, but by **organizing information** so you can engage more effectively.

# Summarization

# Documents You Encounter

- Meeting notes from committees or PLCs
- District policy updates
- Research articles
- Professional development materials

Each valuable. Each time-consuming.

# Source-Grounded AI for Summarization

<div class="sketch-box">

Unlike general-purpose AI:
- Works **only** with documents you upload
- Every answer includes **citations**
- You can **verify** the summary matches the source

This matters for accuracy.

</div>

# Audio Summaries

Some source-grounded tools create **podcast-style summaries**:

- Two AI voices discuss key points
- Natural, engaging format
- Useful while commuting or multitasking
- Can customize the focus

# Task Breakdown & Planning

# Why Complex Tasks Feel Overwhelming

<div class="callout">

They often lack clear structure.

- Writing a grant proposal
- Preparing for accreditation
- Planning a new curriculum unit

Many steps. Not always obvious where to start.

</div>

# AI Can Help Structure

Ask AI to:
- Break a large task into manageable steps
- Suggest a sequence or timeline
- Identify dependencies

This gives you a **starting structure** to adapt.

# The Key Word: Adapt

<div class="sketch-box">

AI does not know:
- Your calendar
- Your workload
- Your school's priorities

**You** adjust timelines, reorder steps, add tasks AI missed, remove what doesn't apply.

AI provides a starting point. You provide professional judgment.
