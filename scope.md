# Scope

## Purpose

A short, defensible micro-credential for K–12 teachers focused exclusively on using Generative AI for professional productivity—not classroom instruction or student use.

**Goals:**
- Asynchronous, self-paced
- ~1 hour of learning via 6 videos + paired screencasts
- Low-risk, ethically grounded, policy-friendly
- Aligned with UNESCO 2024 AI Competency Framework for Teachers
- Aligned with T-GAIC (Teachers' Generative AI Competencies) research
- Can lead into in-person session without requiring one

---

## Audience

- Practicing K–12 teachers
- Mixed AI familiarity (from skeptical to curious)
- Limited time and cognitive bandwidth
- High sensitivity to ethics, privacy, and professional responsibility

---

## Scope Boundaries

### In Scope
- Teacher workflows only: planning, communication, reflection, organization, PD
- Professional productivity tasks
- Ethical and responsible use principles
- Practical prompt engineering for educator contexts

### Explicitly Out of Scope
- Student-facing AI use
- Grading automation
- Classroom AI pedagogy
- AI policy development
- Technical AI/ML concepts

---

## Tools

Standardized on Google's AI suite for consistency and accessibility:

| Tool | Purpose | Why |
|------|---------|-----|
| **Gemini** (gemini.google.com) | General drafting, brainstorming, open-ended tasks | Free for Google Workspace for Education; integrates with Docs, Gmail, Sheets |
| **NotebookLM** (notebooklm.google.com) | Source-grounded Q&A, summarization, audio overviews | Won't hallucinate from uploaded docs; citations for verification |

**Rationale:**
- Both free for educators with Google Workspace for Education
- FERPA-compliant with school accounts
- Data not used for AI training when using school accounts
- Reduces tool fragmentation and cognitive load

**Advanced option (mentioned, not required):**
- Google AI Studio for custom personas/system instructions

---

## Production Format

### Studio Recording (90-minute session)
- 6 conceptual videos
- Teleprompter delivery, professional studio setting
- Focus on "why" and mental models
- **Tool-agnostic scripts** — concepts like "source-grounded AI" and "general-purpose AI" instead of brand names
- Timeless content that won't date as tools evolve

### Home Screencasts (recorded separately)
- 6 practical demos, one paired with each video
- 2-4 minutes each
- **Tool-specific demos** using Gemini and NotebookLM
- Can be updated as tools evolve without re-recording studio content
- Tools introduced in Video 1, demonstrated in screencasts

---

## Instructional Strategy

### Meta-Learning Approach
**Teachers use AI to learn how to use AI.** Each screencast demonstrates the tools while teaching how to use them. This models the exploratory, iterative approach teachers can continue on their own.

### Structure
Each video + screencast pair:
1. Introduces a concept (studio video)
2. Frames it within ethical and professional norms
3. Demonstrates practical application with tools (screencast)
4. Provides ready-to-use prompt templates
5. Produces an artifact or reflection

### Mental Models Emphasized
- **Autocomplete on steroids** — AI predicts likely words, doesn't reason
- **Junior assistant** — Fast and flexible, but requires supervision
- **Open-book generalist vs. closed-book librarian** — Gemini (broad) vs. NotebookLM (source-grounded)
- **Echo of the internet** — AI reflects patterns in training data, including biases

### Pedagogical Level
- Primarily UNESCO "Acquire" level
- Light movement toward early "Deepen" in Videos 4-5
- Designed to build confidence and judgment, not mastery or innovation

### Tone
- Professional, calm, non-evangelical
- AI as supporting tool, never authority or replacement for judgment
- Honest about limitations and appropriate skepticism

---

## Framework Alignment

### UNESCO AI Competency Framework for Teachers (2024)

| Video | UNESCO Dimension(s) | Level |
|-------|---------------------|-------|
| 1. Why GenAI | Human-centred mindset; AI for professional learning | Acquire |
| 2. Foundations | AI foundations & applications | Acquire |
| 3. Ethics | Ethics of AI; Human-centred mindset | Acquire |
| 4. Writing & Communication | AI foundations & applications; AI for professional learning | Acquire → Deepen |
| 5. Organizing Information | AI foundations & applications | Acquire → Deepen |
| 6. Reflection & Growth | AI for professional learning; Human-centred mindset | Acquire |

### T-GAIC Instrument Dimensions

| Dimension | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|
| Technological proficiency (TP) | Videos 2, 4, 5 |
| Risk & ethical awareness (REA) | Video 3 |
| Professional development (GPD) | Videos 1, 4, 6 |
| Pedagogical compatibility (PC) | Intentionally excluded |
| Preparing students (PS) | Intentionally excluded |

## Credentialing Considerations

This micro-credential may be reviewed by:
- District PD offices
- State or regional credentialing bodies
- University or continuing education providers

Therefore it demonstrates:
- **Clear learning outcomes** — Mapped to UNESCO and T-GAIC
- **Reasonable seat-time equivalence** — ~1 hour video + screencast + artifact creation
- **Ethical safeguards** — Explicit privacy, bias, and judgment principles
- **Evidence artifacts** — Required submissions for completion

---

## Completion Requirements

Participants submit:
1. **One AI-assisted professional artifact** (from Videos 4 or 5)
   - Email, plan, template, summary, or task breakdown
2. **One ethics or reflection annotation** (from Videos 3 or 6)
   - Ethics check on AI output, or reflective journal entry
3. **Brief reflective statement** (150-250 words)
   - How AI supported productivity
   - How professional judgment and ethics were applied

## Design Notes

- **Asynchronous-first:** All competencies achievable independently
- **Low-risk scope:** No student data, grading, or instructional AI use
- **Stackable design:** Artifacts and reflections can lead into deeper in-person PD
- **Tool-agnostic principles:** While using Google tools, prompt patterns and ethical principles transfer to other platforms
