## Instrument Overview

The Teachers' Generative AI Competencies (T-GAIC) instrument is a validated 36-item tool for assessing teachers' competencies in integrating GenAI into professional practices. It was developed through literature review, expert validation, think-aloud protocols, and psychometric testing with 478 pre-service and in-service teachers.

### Five Competency Dimensions

| Dimension | Abbr. | Focus | Relevance to This Project |
|-----------|-------|-------|---------------------------|
| **Technological proficiency** | TP | Understanding GenAI tools, functions, limitations | **Core** — Videos 2, 4, 5 |
| **Pedagogical compatibility** | PC | Aligning AI with teaching objectives and student needs | Excluded (classroom focus) |
| **Preparing students** | PS | Building student AI literacy and skills | Excluded (student-facing) |
| **Professional development** | GPD | Using AI for professional growth and communication | **Core** — Videos 1, 4, 6 |
| **Risk & ethical awareness** | REA | Understanding privacy, bias, and responsible use | **Core** — Video 3 |

**This micro-credential targets TP, GPD, and REA. PC and PS are excluded per project scope.**

## Dimension 1: Technological Proficiency (TP)

**Definition:** Teachers' competencies in selecting various GenAI tools, knowing their technical functionality and affordances.

**Key Competencies:**
- Understanding types of GenAI tools and their distinct purposes
- Recognizing technical affordances and limitations of GenAI systems
- Selecting appropriate tools for specific professional tasks
- Understanding how GenAI generates outputs (pattern prediction)
- Knowing when to trust—and when to verify—AI-generated content

**Example Item:** "I am competent in choosing and using available GenAI tools to create lesson materials."

**Relevant Frameworks:**
- UNESCO "AI foundations and applications" dimension
- European DigCompEdu framework (tool selection competencies)
- AI-PACK framework (algorithmic literacy)

**Application in This Project:**
- Video 2 covers how GenAI works (pattern prediction, hallucination, bias)
- Videos 4-5 develop practical tool selection and prompting skills
- Mental models: "autocomplete on steroids," "junior assistant"

---

## Dimension 4: Professional Development & Communication (GPD)

**Definition:** Teachers' competence in keeping up with GenAI technology development and engaging and sharing best practices with colleagues and community.

**Key Competencies:**
- Using GenAI to support daily teaching management and workflow
- Facilitating communication with colleagues and stakeholders
- Creating and sharing GenAI-based instructional resources
- Automating routine and administrative tasks
- Engaging in continuous professional learning about AI

**Example Item:** "I am competent at creating and sharing GenAI-based instructional resources within teacher networks and professional communities."

**Related Competencies (from instrument):**
- Using GenAI to automate routine and administrative tasks
- Facilitating communication with parents, students, and colleagues
- Keeping current with GenAI developments

**Application in This Project:**
- Video 1 introduces professional productivity framing
- Video 4 covers writing and communication workflows
- Video 6 addresses reflection and sustainable practice
- Core focus: planning, drafting, organizing, communicating

---

## Dimension 5: Risk & Ethical Awareness (REA)

**Definition:** Teachers' competence in comprehending AI regulations and understanding potential risks and their roles pertaining to risk, ethics, and responsible AI use.

**Key Competencies:**
- Applying regulations: copyright, plagiarism, academic integrity
- Understanding potential risks: misuse, over-reliance, misinformation
- Identifying bias in AI-generated content
- Protecting privacy and handling data responsibly
- Maintaining human oversight and professional judgment

**Example Item:** "I am familiar with and competent in applying regulations such as copyright, plagiarism, and academic integrity when using GenAI tools."

**Ethical Principles Aligned:**
| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Privacy** | Never input identifiable personal data |
| **Accuracy** | Verify AI outputs; assume potential for error |
| **Bias awareness** | Review outputs for problematic patterns |
| **Human oversight** | AI supports; teachers decide |
| **Accountability** | Teachers responsible for all AI-assisted outputs |

**Application in This Project:**
- Video 3 focuses entirely on ethical AI use
- Privacy principle: "When in doubt, leave it out"
- Human agency emphasized throughout

## Dimensions Excluded from This Project

### Pedagogical Compatibility (PC)
**Definition:** Teachers' confidence in aligning the pedagogical use of GenAI tools with diverse teaching and learning objectives, pedagogical approaches, and students' needs.

**Why Excluded:** This project focuses on teacher professional productivity, not classroom instruction or curriculum design with AI.

### Preparing Students (PS)
**Definition:** Teachers' competence in preparing students with the necessary GenAI knowledge, skills, and attitudes to engage with GenAI-empowered learning and future workplace.

**Why Excluded:** Student-facing AI use is explicitly out of scope for this micro-credential.

## Instrument Psychometrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total items | 36 (across 5 dimensions) |
| Cronbach's alpha | >0.90 (overall and per dimension) |
| RMSEA | 0.078 |
| CFI | 0.946 |
| TLI | 0.934 |
| Variance explained | 72% |

---

## Relationship to UNESCO Framework

The T-GAIC dimensions map to UNESCO AI Competency Framework for Teachers:

| T-GAIC | UNESCO Equivalent |
|--------|-------------------|
| Technological proficiency (TP) | AI foundations & applications |
| Risk & ethical awareness (REA) | Ethics of AI |
| Professional development (GPD) | AI for professional learning |
| Pedagogical compatibility (PC) | AI pedagogy |
| Preparing students (PS) | AI pedagogy (student outcomes) |

Both frameworks emphasize the same foundational competencies; T-GAIC provides validated measurement items while UNESCO provides curricular structure.
