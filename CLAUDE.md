# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

A micro-credential for K-12 teachers on using Generative AI for professional productivity (~1 hour, asynchronous). Focus is exclusively on teacher workflows—not classroom instruction or student-facing AI.

## File Structure

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `scope.md` | Project scope, audience, boundaries, framework alignment |
| `video-scripts.md` | Teleprompter-ready scripts for 6 studio videos |
| `screencast-guide.md` | Demo instructions for 6 home-recorded screencasts |
| `unesco-framework-reference.md` | Extracted UNESCO framework content relevant to this project |
| `t-gaic-reference.md` | Extracted T-GAIC instrument dimensions relevant to this project |

## Content Architecture

**Two-track production model:**
- **Studio videos** (tool-agnostic): Conceptual content using terms like "general-purpose AI" and "source-grounded AI"
- **Screencasts** (tool-specific): Practical demos using specific tools (currently Gemini + NotebookLM)

This separation allows screencast updates without re-recording studio content.

## Framework Alignment

Content maps to:
- UNESCO AI Competency Framework for Teachers (2024) — primarily "Acquire" level
- T-GAIC instrument dimensions (TP, REA, GPD)

See alignment tables in `scope.md` and appendix of `video-scripts.md`.

## Scope Boundaries

**In scope:** Teacher professional productivity (planning, communication, reflection, organization)

**Explicitly out of scope:** Student-facing AI, grading automation, classroom pedagogy, AI policy development

## Writing Guidelines

- Tone: Professional, calm, non-evangelical
- AI framing: Supporting tool, never authority or replacement for judgment
- Mental models to use: "autocomplete on steroids," "junior assistant," "echo of the internet"
- Privacy principle: "When in doubt, leave it out"
